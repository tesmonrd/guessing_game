Hey there, this is the README file for RickTesmond's guessing game!
Before I get into the description, how about a joke:

Question: What time does Sean Connery usually go to Wimbledon?
Answer (read in a Sean Connery voice): Around tennish!


Github project name: Guessing_game
Author: Rick Tesmond

Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I created a guessing game that asks the user questions about my life. Most of the questions are "yes" or "no" but there are some that require number guessing. At the end of the quiz, the user gets a report on how well they know me.

There are currently six questions, including the first question asking for the users name.

Hope you enjoy the game!
